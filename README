Some examples on using Tornado in a non-blocking way.
Don't forget to run pip install -r requirements.pip (and yes, you should be
using virtualenv)

===

First example: access a REST service with Tornado's non blocking HTTP client.

In one terminal: python server.py
In other terminals: curl localhost:8888
If you want to stress it: ab -c 2 -n 50 -t 30 localhost:8888/

===

Second example: use a resque like (dreque) to handle long jobs.

Install and run redis-server;
In one terminal: python server_with_dreque.py
In another terminal: python worker_with_dreque.py
In other terminals: curl localhost:8888
If you want to stress it: ab -c 2 -n 50 -t 30 localhost:8888/

Known bug: the very first work sent to the queue is blocking until the worker
is killed.
